# Speech Command Recognition Project üó£Ô∏è

This project focuses on building and evaluating deep learning models for speech command recognition. It reproduces and extends the work from the paper *"Speech Command Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network"* by Li and Zhou, using the [Google Speech Commands Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands).

## Objectives

- Reproduce baseline models: Vanilla, MLP, and CNN
- Compare audio parametrizations: MFCC vs Log-Spectrograms
- Evaluate the impact of class imbalance and noise (SNR)
- Explore model robustness through architecture and data augmentation
